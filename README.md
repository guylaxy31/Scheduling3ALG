# Scheduling3ALG

Scheduling Algorithm
Students are requested to write a program to test how the various algorithms fit the process set. Demonstrate at least 3 experimental hypotheses. Each experiment is tested with 3 algorithms. Students may have different assumptions not as the examples below.

Assumption 1 if there is a set of 60 processes. Students create a series of processes by randomly 70% of the short burst time (2 to 8 milliseconds) processing, 20% of medium burst time (20 to 30 milliseconds) processes, 10% of long past time (35 to 40 milliseconds) process, and when the process is completed, randomly queue up the process in the queue.

Assumption 2 if there is a set of 40 processes. Students create a series of processes by randomly 50% of the short burst time (2 to 8 milliseconds) processing, 30% of medium burst time (20 to 30 milliseconds) processes, 20% of long past time (35 to 40 milliseconds) process, and when the process is completed, randomly queue up the process in the queue.

Assumption 3 if there is a set of 20 processes. Students create a series of processes by randomly 40% of the short burst time (2 to 8 milliseconds) processing, 40% of medium burst time (20 to 30 milliseconds) processes, 20% of long past time (35 to 40 milliseconds) process, and when the process is completed, randomly queue up the process in the queue.
